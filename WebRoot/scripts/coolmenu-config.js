/*
Now we are ready for the properties of each level. For those of that have used the old
coolmenus for coolframemenu I will try and explain how this works like this:
level[0] = top items
level[1] = sub items
level[2] = sub2 items
level[3] = sub3 items and so on....
All menus will inherit the properties, and all properties does only HAVE to be spesifed on the top level.
If a level doesn't have on property spesified it will look for it on the last level that was spesified,
if it still doesn't exist it will get the properties from level[0]

Which means that if you set the background color on level[0] to "black" and doesn't spesify any more levels or doesn't
spesify the background color on the last level you spesified ALL menus will get the color from level[0]

Did that make sense at all? This can be a little hard to understand, look at the different examples on my site
and play with and I am sure you'll get what I mean.
*/

//TOP LEVEL PROPERTIES - ALL OF THESE MUST BE SPESIFIED FOR LEVEL[0]
oCMenu.level[0]=new Array() //Add this for each new level
oCMenu.level[0].width=110 //The default width for each level[0] (top) items. You can override this on each item by spesifying the width when making the item. - Value: px || "%"
oCMenu.level[0].height=20 //The default height for each level[0] (top) items. You can override this on each item by spesifying the height when making the item. - Value: px || "%"
oCMenu.level[0].bgcoloroff="lightblue" //The default background color for each level[0] (top) items. You can override this on each item by spesifying the backgroundcolor when making the item. - Value: "color"
oCMenu.level[0].bgcoloron="blue" //The default "on" background color for each level[0] (top) items. You can override this on each item by spesifying the "on" background color when making the item. - Value: "color"
oCMenu.level[0].textcolor="black" //The default text color for each level[0] (top) items. You can override this on each item by spesifying the text color when making the item. - Value: "color"

oCMenu.level[0].border=0 //The border size for all level[0] (top) items. - Value: px
oCMenu.level[0].bordercolor="blue" //The border color for all level[0] (top) items. - Value: "color"
oCMenu.level[0].offsetX=1 //The X offset of the submenus of this item. This does not affect the first submenus, but you need it here so it can be the default value for all levels. - Value: px
oCMenu.level[0].offsetY=1 //The Y offset of the submenus of this item. This does not affect the first submenus, but you need it here so it can be the default value for all levels. - Value: px
oCMenu.level[0].NS4font="tahoma,arial,helvetica"
oCMenu.level[0].NS4fontSize="2"

/*New: Added animation features that can be controlled on each level.*/
oCMenu.level[0].clip=0 //Set this to 1 if you want the submenus of this level to "slide" open in a animated clip effect. - Value: 0 || 1
oCMenu.level[0].clippx=0 //If you have clip spesified you can set how many pixels it will clip each timer in here to control the speed of the animation. - Value: px
oCMenu.level[0].cliptim=0 //This is the speed of the timer for the clip effect. Play with this and the clippx to get the desired speed for the clip effect (be carefull though and try and keep this value as high or possible or you can get problems with NS4). - Value: milliseconds
//Filters - This can be used to get some very nice effect like fade, slide, stars and so on. EXPLORER5.5+ ONLY - If you set this to a value it will override the clip on the supported browsers
oCMenu.level[0].filter=0 //VALUE: 0 || "filter specs"

/*And last but not least the align variable.

This spesifies how the submenus of this level comes out.
Values:
"bottom": The sub menus of this level will come out on the top of this item
"top": The sub menus of this level will come out on the bottom of this item
"left": The sub menus of this level will come out on the right of this item
"right": The sub menus of this level will come out on the left of this item

In generally "left" and "right" works best for menus in columns and "top" and "bottom" works best for menus in rows.
But by all means feel free to play with it.

If you have set pagecheck to 1 above this is what the pagecheck will change when reaching the bounderies of the page.
If it reaches the right boundery and it's aligned left it will change the align to right and so on.
